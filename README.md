# üêß Linux?

I'm sorry, but I'm not able to release SkEditor+ without rewriting it to another framework or language that I know less.
You can try using e.g. [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), but I can't officially  support it.


# üîß Tech stack

SkEditor+ is written in WPF, C#, using HandyControls to frontend and AvalonEdit to editor.

# üì£ Spread the word!

If you would like to support us and promote SkEditor+, you can:
- Add a GitHub Star to the project!
- Recommend to friends!
- Use built-in Discord RPC!
- Maybe you'll come up with something else?
